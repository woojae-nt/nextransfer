			<h2>Our Vision</h2>
			<p>
	We see a paradigm shift in finance brought on by the demands of the true stakeholders and constituents to serve the needs of the many, and not only the few.
	As resonated in Abraham Lincolnâ€™s speech in 1863 during the American Civil War,
	Finance of the people, for the people, by the people.

			<h2>Our Team</h2>
			<!-- <p>
	Our team collectively houses diverse experience in finance, investing, marketing and tech across leading multinational companies and financial institutions. This exposure has 
	served as  the impetus for wanting to change the system from the inside. Our team have seen friends, family and colleagues who have lived and worked in various countries and
	have spent thousands of their own money on fees and other charges for cross-border money transferring. We have felt the pain of losing money firsthand. This makes us 
	especially excited to liberate people from the old, inefficient, slow and highly expensive international financial system.
